# UserTesting Round 1 — Pre-flight setup

One-time setup work the developer does before submitting Round 1 to UserTesting. Each step has a time budget and a "validate before continuing" check. Run all four in order; don't pay for sessions until Step 3 (pre-flight self-test) passes.

Round-1 plan reference: `project_pre_launch_todo.md` (memory) and the locked plan at `~/.claude/plans/should-i-run-a-wondrous-hollerith.md`.

## Step 1 — Dedicated Gemini API key with a $5 billing cap (~10 min)

The point: you don't want a runaway tester loop draining your real Gemini budget, and you don't want the dev key tied to your primary email/billing account.

### 1a. Create a sandbox GCP project

1. Sign into **https://console.cloud.google.com/** with the Google account that owns the email_sentinel Apps Script project.
2. Top header → project picker dropdown → **New Project**.
3. Project name: `emailsentinel-usertesting-r1` (or similar). Leave organization default. **Create**.

### 1b. Set the budget cap before generating the key

1. Once the new project loads, hamburger menu → **Billing**. Link a billing account if it isn't already linked.
2. Hamburger → **Billing** → **Budgets & alerts** → **Create budget**.
3. Scope: this project only.
4. Amount: **$5** total budget (USD).
5. Threshold rules: check 50 %, 90 %, 100 % so you get email alerts as testers consume quota.

> ⚠ The budget alerts you, but does NOT auto-kill spending. To hard-cap, also reduce the daily quota: hamburger → **APIs & Services** → enable **Generative Language API** (Gemini) on this project → **Quotas** → set the daily request quota to **200 requests/day**. (10 testers × ~10 calls each = 100 calls; 200 gives headroom but caps a runaway loop.)

### 1c. Generate the API key

1. Open **https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey** (the consumer-facing AI Studio).
2. Top right, click your account avatar, switch to the new project (`emailsentinel-usertesting-r1`).
3. **Create API key** → select your new sandbox project as the host.
4. Copy the key. Save it in your password manager labeled `UserTesting Round 1 — Gemini key — created <YYYY-MM-DD>`.

### 1d. Validate the key works

1. In emAIl Sentinel running on your dev account, open Settings → paste this key as a temporary test → **Test Gemini** → confirm the toast reads *"Gemini OK — model responded."*
2. **Replace your real dev key after the test** so the throwaway isn't sitting in your own settings.

## Step 2 — Marketplace SDK install URL (~2–3 hours, NOT 10 min)

> ⚠ **Correction over an earlier draft of this walkthrough.** The Apps Script Editor's "Test deployments" dialog only installs the add-on for the currently-signed-in (dev) account — it does NOT generate a public install URL the way Web App test deployments do. Workspace add-ons distribute exclusively through the Google Workspace Marketplace, so external testers need a Marketplace SDK install URL even for unverified pre-launch testing. This makes Step 2 substantially heavier than originally scoped.

The 2–3 hour setup is "free" pull-forward of pre-launch critical-path work — it has to happen for the public launch anyway. Walk through `docs/marketplace_checklist.txt` Parts 1–3 in order:

### 2a. Enable the Marketplace SDK

1. **https://console.cloud.google.com** → top bar → select the Cloud project linked to your Apps Script project. (Verify in the Apps Script editor → Project Settings → Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project section if unsure.)
2. Hamburger → **APIs & Services** → **Library** → search "Google Workspace Marketplace SDK" → **Enable**.
3. Hamburger → **APIs & Services** → **Enabled APIs & services** → click **Google Workspace Marketplace SDK**. You'll use three tabs: OVERVIEW, APP CONFIGURATION, STORE LISTING.

### 2b. App Configuration tab

Paste in everything from `docs/marketplace_checklist.txt` Part 2:

- App name (must match OAuth consent screen exactly)
- Icon, banner, screenshots
- OAuth scopes (must match `appsscript.json`)
- Developer details
- ToS URL, Privacy URL
- Detailed description

### 2c. Store Listing tab

- Short description
- Category
- Regions: **United States only** (matches `legal/TERMS.md` §2)
- Languages: English

### 2d. OAuth consent screen — set publishing status to "In Production"

Hamburger → **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**. If publishing status is "Testing", click **Publish App** to move to "In Production". This allows external Google accounts to install (with the unverified-app warning) up to a 100-user lifetime cap until OAuth verification clears.

### 2e. Get the install URL

After saving the SDK draft (don't click "Publish to Marketplace" — that triggers Google's listing review on top of OAuth review), the SDK gives you a pre-publication install URL. Format and exact location of this URL varies with the current Cloud Console UI; verify by navigating Marketplace SDK → OVERVIEW or APP CONFIGURATION → look for "Install URL" or "Direct install link".

### 2f. Validate the URL works

1. On a different device or browser (Incognito, signed into a fresh non-dev Google account that is NOT in your Workspace org), paste the URL.
2. You should see Google's "unverified app" consent screen → **Continue** → **Allow**.
3. Reload Gmail. The emAIl Sentinel icon should appear in the right rail. Open it. Home card should load.
4. **If anything fails here, fix it before Round 1.** Testers cannot get past install issues you haven't already discovered.

### 2g. Skip-this-step alternative

If you don't have 2–3 hours for SDK setup right now, an acceptable temporary path is to share the Apps Script project as **Viewer** with each tester's Gmail address. They install via script.google.com. Trade-off: testers get source-code access. Acceptable for a small one-time UserTesting cohort, but the LICENSE-protected proprietary stance is weakened. If you take this path, **flip `email_sentinel` to private on GitHub first** (after the icon migration documented elsewhere) so the source the testers see is also the only source publicly visible.

---

## Step 3 — Pre-flight self-test on a fresh Google account (~30 min)

This is the most important step. You run Script A end-to-end against the deployed add-on as if you were a UserTesting tester, with a stopwatch — including the Pro promo redemption and Chat-webhook setup.

### 3a. What you need

- A Google account that **isn't your dev account**. Easiest: create a free Gmail (`yourname-test+1@gmail.com` or similar) just for this. Or use a personal account separate from the dev one.
- A clean browser session signed into that account.
- A stopwatch (your phone is fine).
- The fresh test account must have **Google Chat enabled** (Script A's Round 1 screener requires Chat-enabled testers). Verify by visiting `chat.google.com` and confirming the Spaces sidebar appears.
- A **single-use Pro promo code** minted for this self-test run (one of the codes you generated in Step 1e). Use a different code than the ten codes you reserve for paying testers.
- `PROMO_SERVICE_URL` must be set as a Script Property on the test-deployment Apps Script project — without it the home card hides the promo redemption section at the bottom and Task 2b is impossible.

### 3b. Procedure

1. Open `usertesting/docs/script_a_core.md` fresh — read it through once before starting. (20-min target. `script_b_power.md` is **retired** — see its banner. Do not pre-flight Script B.)
2. Start the stopwatch.
3. Run Task 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 in order, doing exactly what the script says. No shortcuts a real tester wouldn't take. Read each task aloud as if you were a UserTesting participant thinking out loud.
4. Note any moment of confusion, broken behavior, or dead-end. Even minor ones — a verbal "wait, what is this asking me to do?" is a finding worth fixing.
5. Stop the timer at the end of Task 5.

### 3c. Pass thresholds

| Script | Self-test target | If you go over |
|---|---|---|
| Script A (core + 5 Google channels) | ≤ 14 min as developer | Real testers will go ~50 % longer = > 21 min and may not finish. Task 2c (Chat webhook) is the most variable — if it consistently runs > 5 min in self-test, consider pre-supplying a webhook URL instead and reducing Task 2c to a paste step. |

### 3d. Things to specifically spot-check during pre-flight

- Does the home card communicate "what is this product?" within 30 seconds of opening the add-on for the first time? (Script A Task 1 hinges on this.)
- Does the **"Enter a promo code to upgrade to Pro"** section appear at the bottom of the home card when on Free tier with `PROMO_SERVICE_URL` set, and disappear after redemption? (If it persists after redemption, the post-redeem `updateCard` regressed.)
- Does Task 2c's chat.google.com walkthrough work as written? Specifically: does **Apps & integrations ▸ Webhooks** still exist in the space-name dropdown, or has Google moved it again? Update Task 2c step 4 if the menu has shifted.
- Do all five Google channels actually fire from a single rule? Check Calendar, Sheets, Tasks, Docs, Chat each show an alert within ~30 seconds of the manual scan — alert dispatch order is sequential, so missing tail-end channels (Docs, Chat) usually mean the run hit `MAX_RUN_MS` before they got their turn. If so, simplify the rule prompt to reduce Gemini latency.
- Does the unverified-app consent warning's wording match what's in your task scripts ("Continue → Allow")? Google occasionally tweaks the consent UI; if the buttons are renamed, update the scripts before submitting.
- After the alert fires, is the activity log line clear and reassuring to a non-technical tester? ("Calendar event created" is fine; "MCP alert sent to: …" is jargon.)
- Does the home card show a **Scan email every** dropdown above a filled **Start scheduled scans** button? Confirm Script A's briefing tells testers to ignore both — they may otherwise click Start scheduled scans and burn your $5 Gemini sandbox budget by leaving monitoring on after the session ends.

### 3e. Fix what you find before Step 4

Time budget: 30 min self-test + up to 60 min script trimming / minor add-on edits. If you find structural issues (e.g., the install flow is broken, Gemini key entry is unintuitive), it's better to fix and re-run pre-flight than to ship those issues to 10 paid sessions.

---

## Step 4 — Fill placeholders + submit Round 1 to UserTesting (~30 min)

> **Round 1 scope (decided 2026-04-29, expanded 2026-05-07):** All 10 sessions run **Script A** (core install + first rule + all five Google channels including Chat). SMS-path testing (Script B) is **retired** for all rounds — see `script_b_power.md` banner. The "Start scheduled scans" / auto-trigger path is also out of scope (it cannot deliver a result inside a 20-min session).

### 4a. Mint per-tester promo codes

Each tester needs a **unique single-use Pro promo code** so Task 2b's redemption flow flips them to Pro and unlocks the Google Chat channel. Two ways to mint:

**Recommended — local Python admin tool at `tools/promo/`** (one-time `.env` + `ADMIN_TOKEN` setup; see `tools/promo/__init__.py` docstring):

```bash
# CLI:
python -m tools.promo.cli mint usertest-round-002 11 --label "Round 2 — minted YYYY-MM-DD"

# Or web UI (Mint form + per-row Assign buttons):
python -m tools.promo.server   # http://127.0.0.1:5057
```

Either path auto-creates a tracking file at `promo_codes/<batch>.txt` with all codes pre-populated. The web UI's per-row Assign button lets you click into a row and enter Name / Email / UT session — both the Sheet and the local file update in one shot.

**Fallback — Apps Script editor** (works without Python tool setup):

1. Open the standalone admin/service project at script.google.com — same project that hosts `PromoCodeService.gs`.
2. In `scripts/PromoCodeAdmin.gs`, edit `BATCH_NAME`, `BATCH_QTY`, `BATCH_LABEL` at the top of the file.
3. Pick `runGenerateBatch` from the function dropdown; click Run.
4. Logger output lists the new codes; the Sheet has new rows. **Revert** the constants before any future commit.

Either path: generate **11 codes** total (10 for testers + 1 reserved for your own pre-flight self-test in Step 3a). Save them outside git — `promo_codes/<batch>.txt` is auto-created and gitignored if you used the Python tool, or your password manager for the editor path. Confirm `PROMO_SERVICE_URL` is set in the **add-on project's** Script Properties (not the standalone project) — without it the redemption section at the bottom of the home card does not render.

### 4b. Fill placeholders

The Script A file (`script_a_core.md`) contains `<DEV_GEMINI_KEY>`, `<TEST_DEPLOYMENT_URL>`, and `<TESTER_PROMO_CODE>` placeholders. Don't replace them in the repo — those values are per-round (and per-tester for the promo code) secrets and shouldn't end up in git history.

Instead:

1. Copy the full text of `script_a_core.md`.
2. Paste into a temp file per tester (`usertesting/outgoing/round_1/script_a_filled_tester_<N>.md` — the `outgoing/` directory is gitignored) OR paste directly into UserTesting's task editor and submit each session individually.
3. In each per-tester copy, replace `<DEV_GEMINI_KEY>` with the key from Step 1, `<TEST_DEPLOYMENT_URL>` with the URL from Step 2, and `<TESTER_PROMO_CODE>` with **a different one** of the 10 codes minted in Step 4a — never reuse the same code across two testers (single-use enforcement will lock the second tester out of Pro).
4. After the round closes (and definitely before any future round), rotate the Gemini key (revoke old, generate new in the same sandbox project), create a fresh test deployment URL, and **void any unredeemed promo codes** via the standalone admin project — Round-1 testers shouldn't retain working access.

### 4c. Sign up for UserTesting

If you don't already have an account: **https://www.usertesting.com/** → sign up. Onboarding asks about your company / use case; free-text answers are fine.

### 4d. Configure the test — Script A only, 10 sessions

1. Create a new test → **Unmoderated** / **Self-serve**.
2. Devices: **Desktop only** (the add-on is desktop Gmail).
3. Browser: any (Chrome and Firefox both work for Gmail).
4. Session length: **20 minutes** (UserTesting prices the same up to 30 min; this gives testers headroom for the Chat-webhook step).
5. Tester profile filters (paste from Script A's "Screener questions" section):
   - Heavy Gmail user (50+ emails/day)
   - One of: small business owner / freelancer / salesperson / real estate agent / paralegal / recruiter
   - US-based
   - **Google Chat enabled** in their Google account (verifiable at chat.google.com — Spaces sidebar visible). School / enterprise accounts with Chat disabled do NOT qualify.
   - Has installed a Gmail add-on or browser extension before, OR comfortable installing software when given a link
6. Tasks: paste Script A's 5 tasks, one per task field. Use the filled-in text from Step 4b. **Each session must use a different promo code** — UserTesting's "duplicate test" flow makes this easy: clone the test 10 times, edit only the `<TESTER_PROMO_CODE>` line in Task 2b for each.
7. Session count: **10 sessions** (one per per-tester filled script).
8. Submit.

### 4e. Pay

Roughly **$49 × 10 = $490** total. UserTesting charges per session at submission.

---

## Step 5 — When sessions return (1–2 weeks later)

UserTesting emails you when each session completes. Recordings come back gradually over 1–2 weeks; some testers are fast, some take days.

### 5a. Watch and note

```
cp usertesting/docs/triage_template.md usertesting/findings/round_1_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_findings.md
```

Open the new findings file. Watch each recording at 1.5 × speed. Fill in the findings table as you go — one row per distinct issue, with verbatim quotes when possible.

### 5b. Group and fix

After all 10 sessions are watched, sort the findings table by severity (5+ testers = critical, 2–4 = important, 1 = backlog). Fix critical + important findings in priority order. Push fixes to the live test deployment (`clp`). Update the **Fix status** column in the findings file as each is shipped.

### 5c. Optional Round 2

After fixes ship, optionally run a smaller Round 2 (~5 sessions, ~$245, unmoderated) to verify the regressions are gone before Marketplace submission. Use the same scripts (no changes unless you also revised them based on Round 1 feedback) and a fresh sandbox-project Gemini key.

## Round-1 cost & time budget (locked)

| Item | Cost | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Step 1 — Sandbox GCP project + capped Gemini key | $0 (until tester usage; capped at $5) | ~10 min hands-on + hours/days waiting on Google's project-quota approval if your account hits that limit |
| Step 2 — Marketplace SDK setup + install URL | $0 | **~2–3 hours** (pull-forward of pre-launch critical-path work; the SDK has to be configured for public launch anyway) |
| Step 3 — Pre-flight self-test on fresh Google account | $0 | ~30 min + ≤60 min trim/fix |
| Step 4 — Mint per-tester promo codes + UserTesting account + Round 1 submission (10 sessions, all Script A, 20-min) | ~$490 | ~30 min (10 min code minting + 20 min test setup) |
| Wait for sessions to come back | $0 | 1–2 weeks (your time: 0) |
| Step 5 — Triage + fix | $0 | ~3–4 hr review + 4–10 hr fixes |
| Optional Round 2 | ~$245 | ~2 hr review |
| **Total Round 1 only** | **~$490** | **~12–14 hr of dev time over ~3 weeks** |

Calendar runs in parallel with the OAuth-verification wait, so launch date isn't pushed. Step 2's Marketplace SDK setup also satisfies a launch requirement — you're not adding work to the launch path, just sequencing it earlier.
