## App Overview (Reviewer Summary)

emAIl Sentinel™ is a contextual Gmail add-on that runs entirely within
the user's Google account (Google Apps Script). When the user opens an
email and clicks "Evaluate this email" in the add-on panel, it evaluates
that one open message against user-defined plain-English rules using the
Google Gemini API, and — when a rule matches — delivers alerts through
channels the user explicitly enables: Google Calendar,
Google Sheets, Google Tasks, Google Docs, Google Chat webhooks, SMS via
the user's choice of provider (six built-in presets plus a generic
webhook for any other provider), or custom Model Context Protocol (MCP)
endpoints / HTTPS webhooks.

The add-on has no external backend database. Gmail access is limited to
the message the user currently has open (the current-message contextual
scope) — there is no background scanning and no access to any other mail.
Data is accessed and processed only to provide user-facing functionality
requested by the user. No restricted scope is requested.

## Scopes Requested & Justifications

### 1) https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.execute

**Purpose:** Required to run as a Gmail add-on.
**Why necessary:** Granted implicitly by installing any Gmail add-on. The
add-on cannot render cards in the Gmail sidebar without this scope.

---

### 2) https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.readonly

**Purpose:** Read the message the user currently has open (sender,
subject, received date, attachment filenames, and up to the first 2,000
characters of the plain-text body) when the user explicitly clicks
"Evaluate this email", for rule evaluation by the Gemini API.
**Why necessary:** The core product feature is semantic rule evaluation
of the email the user is looking at. The contextual current-message
scope is the narrowest possible Gmail access for this: the add-on cannot
read any other messages, cannot search the mailbox, and performs no
background access. No messages are modified, sent, deleted, archived,
labeled, or moved.
**Data use:** Used solely to evaluate user-defined rules and format alert
messages the user configures. Not used for advertising, resale, or
training generalized models.

---

### 3) https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar

**Purpose:** Create Calendar events as alerts when the user enables the
Google Calendar alert channel on a rule.
**Why necessary:** CalendarApp requires the full calendar scope; the
narrower calendar.events scope is only compatible with the advanced
Calendar service, which is not used here.
**Control:** Only writes to calendars selected by the user. Only used
when the user enables "Create calendar event" on a specific rule.

---

### 4) https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets

**Purpose:** Append rows to a Google Sheets spreadsheet as alerts when
the user enables the Google Sheets alert channel on a rule.
**Control:** Only writes to the spreadsheet the user has selected (or a
spreadsheet auto-created in their own Drive if they leave the ID blank).

---

### 5) https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks

**Purpose:** Create Google Tasks as alerts when the user enables the
Google Tasks alert channel on a rule.
**Control:** Only writes to the Task List the user has selected.

---

### 6) https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents

**Purpose:** Append structured alert entries to a Google Doc when the
user enables the Google Docs alert channel on a rule. The Doc is
auto-created in the user's Drive on first use (titled "emAIl Sentinel
— Alert Log") if no Doc ID is configured. Each fired rule appends a
heading with the timestamp + rule name and paragraphs for the email
sender, subject, received time, and the Gemini-formatted alert body.
**Control:** Only writes to the document the user has selected
(or, on first use, creates a new document in the user's own Drive).

---

### 7) https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request

**Purpose:** Make outbound HTTPS calls to user-enabled integrations:
  • Google Gemini API (generativelanguage.googleapis.com) — for rule
    evaluation and alert formatting.
  • The SMS provider the user configures — any provider the user chooses,
    whether it's one of six built-in presets (Textbelt, Telnyx, Plivo,
    Twilio, ClickSend, Vonage) or any HTTPS endpoint the user configures
    as a generic webhook.
  • Google Chat webhook URLs the user configures.
  • MCP server endpoints the user configures (Slack, Microsoft 365 /
    Teams, Asana, or custom endpoints via Model Context Protocol).
**Control:** Only called when the user enables and configures the
corresponding integration.

## Limited Use Compliance Statement

The use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Google
API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
Data is used only to provide user-facing functionality requested by the
user, is not used for advertising, and is not sold or transferred except
as necessary to provide the Service the user has enabled.

---

## Data Storage & Security

- No external backend database.
- All data is processed within the user's own Google Apps Script
  execution context.
- Configuration and settings are stored in Apps Script UserProperties,
  which is per-user, per-script, and private to the user's Google
  account.
- All outbound network calls use HTTPS.
- The Gemini API key is masked in the UI after save (only last 4
  characters shown).

---

## User Control

- Gmail access happens only when the user explicitly clicks "Evaluate
  this email" on an open message — there is no background access.
- Users explicitly enable / disable every integration on every rule.
- Users can delete all stored configuration data at any time by
  uninstalling the add-on, or by running
  `PropertiesService.getUserProperties().deleteAllProperties()` in the
  Apps Script editor.
