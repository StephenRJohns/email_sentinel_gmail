# External integrations
**Duration:** ~3:05 min
**Tool:** Guidde

MCP is the most technical alert channel. Aim this video at the
power-user. Use a **Cloudflare Worker** as the demo MCP server
because it is the simplest reproducible MCP example: free, no
third-party signup beyond Cloudflare itself, no OAuth flow, no
expiring tokens, and the live-logs panel gives clean visual proof
that the alert crossed from Gmail to an external system. The
viewer can copy the same 40-line Worker code from the Help card
and have a working endpoint in about 15 minutes. The video keeps
the Worker code reveal brief; the full code listing lives in the
Help card so viewers do not need to pause and squint.

## Hook (0:00–0:08)
ON-SCREEN: Split screen — "e-mail Sentinel" on the left firing an
alert, Cloudflare Worker logs panel on the right showing the
[ALERT RECEIVED] line scroll in real time.
VOICEOVER:
Connect "e-mail Sentinel" to anything that speaks Model Context
Protocol. Microsoft Teams, Asana, your own server — same alert
pipeline.

## Scene 1 — what MCP is (0:08–0:30)
ON-SCREEN: A simple diagram — "e-mail Sentinel" → POST tools/call →
your MCP server → Teams / Asana / Custom downstream.
VOICEOVER:
MCP is an open protocol for AI agents to call external tools.
"e-mail Sentinel" sends a JSON-RPC call request to any
MCP server you configure. If you have used Claude Desktop or
another agent framework, you have already used the same protocol
— this just wires your inbox to it.

## Scene 2 — where it lives (0:30–0:42)
ON-SCREEN: Settings card → External integrations section.
VOICEOVER:
External integrations live in Settings, and like every other
channel they are free for everyone — no upgrade required.

## Scene 3 — the simplest MCP example (0:42–1:15)
ON-SCREEN: Help card opened — shows the search box and Browse
topics buttons. Type "Integrations" into the search box, click
Search. Results card shows "2 topics matched" — click
"Open: Alert channel setup". Scroll to the Custom Cloudflare
Worker walkthrough subsection and highlight the code block. Then
show the actual Cloudflare dashboard with the Worker already
deployed (named es-demo-mcp).
VOICEOVER:
For this video I am using my Cloudflare account because it is
the easiest target to demo — Cloudflare Workers are free, no
OAuth flow, no bot tokens, nothing that expires, and the Worker
code is forty lines of JavaScript you copy from the Help card.
You would connect to whichever MCP servers you actually need
— Microsoft Teams, Asana, Slack via a self-hosted bridge,
your own internal tools — and you would refer to that server's
documentation for the specifics of its tool name, args, and
authentication. The mechanics in "e-mail Sentinel" are the same
regardless of the target. We will not write the Worker code on
camera; the full listing is in the Help card under External
integrations. What you see on the right is the deployed Worker,
ready to receive alerts.

## Scene 4 — copy the Worker URL (1:15–1:30)
ON-SCREEN: Cloudflare dashboard, Worker overview page. Right-click
the URL at the top (https://es-demo-mcp.jjjjj-enterprises-llc.workers.dev/)
and pick "Copy link address" from the context menu.
VOICEOVER:
Copy the Worker URL from the top of the dashboard. This is the
endpoint "e-mail Sentinel" will POST alerts to.

## Scene 5 — add the MCP server in "e-mail Sentinel" (1:30–2:15)
ON-SCREEN: Switch back to Gmail. Settings → External integrations
→ "+ Add external integration" → server name "Demo MCP" → Type dropdown
already shows "Custom MCP" as default → click Load defaults → endpoint
URL paste the Worker URL → Authorization header value paste
"Bearer es_mcp_demo" → Tool name "log_alert" → Tool
args template stays "{"message":"{{message}}"}" → Save.
VOICEOVER:
Click Add external integration. Name it Demo MCP. The Type dropdown defaults
to Custom MCP — click Load defaults to populate the args template. In
the endpoint URL field, paste the Worker URL we copied. In the
Authorization header value field, paste the literal word Bearer,
capital B, then a space, then the secret you set in the Worker
code. The Bearer prefix is sent verbatim as the Authorization
header, so do not omit it. Tool name is log_alert — the name we
exposed from the Worker. Save.

## Scene 6 — attach to a rule and trigger (2:15–2:40)
ON-SCREEN: Open a rule → check the "Demo MCP" external
integration checkbox → Save → trigger a match. Cut to the
Cloudflare Worker logs panel — the [ALERT RECEIVED] line
appears with the full alert text visible.
VOICEOVER:
On any rule, check the integration, save, and trigger a match.
The Cloudflare Worker logs panel shows the alert arriving in
real time — the bracketed ALERT RECEIVED line is the Worker
console-logging the message field "e-mail Sentinel" sent. From
here, the Worker can do anything code can do — relay to Slack
via webhook, write to a database, call another API.

## Scene 7 — error handling (2:40–2:55)
ON-SCREEN: Activity log showing an MCP error like 'MCP "Demo MCP"
HTTP 401: Unauthorized'.
VOICEOVER:
If the MCP server returns an error — bad token, missing
permission, server down — "e-mail Sentinel" logs it in the Activity
log with the exact response. No silent failures. Other channels
still fire, so a broken MCP does not take your alerts down.

## End card (2:55–3:05)
ON-SCREEN: Logo + Marketplace URL
VOICEOVER:
Connect anything that speaks MCP. Get "e-mail Sentinel" —
link below.

## Production notes

- Scene 3 navigates Help via search: type "Integrations" → Search
  → "Open: Alert channel setup" → scroll to the Cloudflare Worker
  subsection. Verify that subsection and code block are present
  before recording.
- The Cloudflare dashboard log panel is the visual hero. Make
  sure you have clicked **Begin log stream** on the Worker's
  Logs tab before Scene 6, so the live tail is already running
  when the alert fires.
- Do NOT show the SECRET token value in clear text on camera if
  you intend to leave the Worker deployed publicly. Either change
  the secret post-recording, or blur the Authorization header
  value during edit.
- If you ever need to re-shoot for a different MCP target
  (Teams, Asana V2, or a different Custom server), only Scenes 4
  and 5 need to change.
- The framing in Scene 1 explicitly mentions Teams and Asana so
  viewers know other targets exist; the video does not need to
  demo each.

## Recording checklist (Guidde)

Before you start: Gmail open, demo account, Screenshot mode ON, the
Cloudflare Worker `es-demo-mcp` already deployed (per the Help
card walkthrough — the Worker code paste is not on camera), the
Cloudflare dashboard tab already open in another browser tab and
focused on the Worker's overview page (so Scene 4's URL copy is
one click), the Worker's **Observability** tab open in a third browser tab
with **Live** already clicked (so Scene 6's live tail
is already streaming when an alert fires), at least one rule
already saved, side panel open on the home card.

**Guidde capture note:** Guidde captures on user interaction (click, scroll, type), not on tab switches. After each tab switch below, the next step is an explicit click or scroll so the new tab is captured into the recording. Plain hover usually does not trigger a frame.

1. Hit **Start capture** in the Guidde extension.
2. Open `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/` in a new tab. **Click anywhere on the page** (an empty area or the headline) and **scroll down once**, then scroll back up. This forces Guidde to capture the tab.
3. Switch back to Gmail. **Click somewhere in the Gmail content area** (e.g., the inbox row count) so Guidde re-captures the Gmail tab.
4. Click the **3-dot menu** → **Help**.
5. In the Help card, click the **Search help** box, type `Integrations`, then click **Search**. The results card shows "2 topics matched." Click **Open: Alert channel setup**. Scroll to the **Custom — Cloudflare Worker MCP server** subsection and click the code block (or any text within it) so it captures.
6. Click the **Home** button on the Help card to return home.
7. Switch to the **Cloudflare** Worker overview tab. **Click anywhere on the page** (e.g., on the page background or a non-action element) so Guidde captures the new tab before you interact with the URL.
8. Right-click the URL at the top of the page (`https://es-demo-mcp.jjjjj-enterprises-llc.workers.dev/`) and pick **Copy link address** from the context menu.
9. Switch back to Gmail. **Click somewhere in Gmail** (e.g., the inbox area) so Guidde re-captures the Gmail tab.
10. Click the **3-dot menu** → **Settings**.
11. Scroll to the **External integrations** section.
12. Click **+ Add external integration**.
13. Click the **Server name** field, type `Demo MCP`.
14. Confirm the **Type** dropdown reads **Custom MCP** (default for new entries).
15. Click **Load defaults**. The **Tool arguments (JSON)** field auto-fills to `{"message":"{{message}}"}`. Tool name field is blank for Custom MCP by default.
16. Click the **Endpoint URL** field, paste the Worker URL from step 8.
17. Click the **Authorization header value** field. Paste the full header literally — the word `Bearer`, a single space, then your Worker `SECRET` value. Example: `Bearer es_mcp_demo`.
18. Click the **Tool name** field, type `log_alert`.
19. Click **Save**.
20. Click **3-dot menu** → **Rules**.
21. Click an existing rule.
22. Scroll to the **External integrations** section in the rule editor.
23. Check **Demo MCP**.
24. Click **Save**.
25. Click **3-dot menu** → **Scan email now**.
26. Click **Run scan now**.
27. Wait for the green ✅ result card.
28. Switch to the **Cloudflare** Observability tab. **Click on the live-events panel** (or click any of the new event rows) and **scroll down to the latest entry**. The new `[ALERT RECEIVED] <your alert text>` line is at the bottom of the live tail. The click + scroll forces Guidde to capture this tab.
29. Switch back to Gmail. **Click somewhere in Gmail** (e.g., the side-panel header) so Guidde re-captures the Gmail tab.
30. Click **3-dot menu** → **Activity Log**.
31. Scroll to (or trigger separately) a red `MCP "Demo MCP" HTTP 401: Unauthorized` line.
32. Hit **Stop capture** in Guidde.

After capture: blur the Authorization header value if the SECRET
is something you do not want public. Replace the auto-generated
voiceover with the storyboard VOICEOVER lines. The diagram for
Scene 1 ("e-mail Sentinel" → MCP server → Teams / Asana / Custom)
is a graphic, not a screen capture — drop it in during edit.
