# Create a rule
**Duration:** ~2 min
**Tool:** Guidde (linear click-through fits perfectly)

Show how to create one rule from scratch — no starter template — so
viewers learn the field semantics, including a peek at both AI helpers
before canceling and finishing with the defaults.

## Hook (0:00–0:05)
ON-SCREEN: Rules card with "+ New rule" button highlighted.
VOICEOVER:
Rules are how "e-mail Sentinel" decides which emails get alerts.
Here is how to write one.

## Scene 1 — open the editor (0:05–0:15)
ON-SCREEN: Click "+ New rule"; the rule editor opens.
VOICEOVER:
Click New rule. The editor has six things to fill in — name,
the Gmail label to watch, the rule itself, the alert channels,
and the alert format.

## Scene 2 — name and label (0:15–0:30)
ON-SCREEN: Type rule name "Customer Escalation". Pick the Gmail
label — "support/escalations" — from the dropdown.
VOICEOVER:
Give it a short name you will recognize in alerts. Pick the Gmail
label to watch — "e-mail Sentinel" only checks emails inside that
label, so you control exactly what gets evaluated.

## Scene 3 — rule text (0:30–0:50)
ON-SCREEN: Type into the rule text field: "Email from a customer
that mentions cancellation, refund, downgrade, or escalation to a
manager."
VOICEOVER:
Write the rule in plain English. There is no syntax to learn —
Gemini reads each new email and decides whether it fits what
you described.

## Scene 4 — AI rule helper peek (0:50–1:10)
ON-SCREEN: Click "Help me write the rule text". A new card opens
showing a description input and a Generate button. Pause briefly,
then click Cancel to return to the rule editor.
VOICEOVER:
If you are not sure how to phrase the rule, the AI helper can
draft it for you — just describe what you want in plain English
and click Generate. We will stick with what we typed.

## Scene 5 — alert channels (1:10–1:30)
ON-SCREEN: Scroll down; check Calendar, Tasks, and SMS (if
configured). Show the SMS recipient checkboxes.
VOICEOVER:
Pick which channels get the alert. You can fan one rule out to
Calendar, Tasks, SMS, Google Chat — every channel you have set up
in Settings.

## Scene 6 — AI alert-text helper peek (1:30–1:50)
ON-SCREEN: Scroll to the alert format section. Click "Help me write
the alert text". A new card opens showing the selected channels and
a description input. Pause briefly, then click Cancel to return to
the rule editor.
VOICEOVER:
There is the same kind of helper for the alert message itself —
tell it what to include and Gemini writes the format instruction.
The default format works well, so we will leave it blank.

## Scene 7 — save and enable (1:50–2:00)
ON-SCREEN: Click Save. Back on Rules card, the new rule shows as
⏸ OFF. Click the **On** toggle.
VOICEOVER:
Save, then enable. The first time "e-mail Sentinel" sees the label
it baselines existing messages — no flood of old alerts. New
mail from now on goes through Gemini.

## End card (2:00–2:05)
ON-SCREEN: Logo + Marketplace URL
VOICEOVER:
Plain English. No regex. Get "e-mail Sentinel" — link below.

## Production notes

- Pre-create the "support/escalations" Gmail label before recording
  so it shows up in the dropdown.
- The AI helpers are available to everyone — they open when clicked
  with no upgrade prompt.
- When you click "Help me write the rule text" in Scene 4, the card
  pre-populates its input with whatever you typed in the rule field —
  that is intentional and looks natural on camera.
- When you click "Help me write the alert text" in Scene 6, the card
  shows the channels you checked (Calendar, Tasks, SMS) — tick those
  first so the card context line is populated.
