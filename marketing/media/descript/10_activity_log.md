> **OUTDATED (2026-07-26):** flow changed to contextual-only "Evaluate this email" — re-record. Scheduled scans, label scanning, and the Reset baseline button no longer exist; log entries now come from on-demand Evaluate this email runs.

# Activity log & troubleshooting
**Duration:** 120 s
**Tool:** Descript (heavier on narration than clicks)

The "the alert did not fire" video. Pre-empt the support questions
that turn into 1-star reviews. Cover: how to read the log, common
reasons rules do not fire, and the Reset baseline lever.

---

## Hook (0:00–0:08)
ON-SCREEN: Activity log card with a few entries — some
"MATCH! ..." in green, one "No match" line, one "FAILED" line in
red.
VOICEOVER:
If a rule is not firing, the Activity log tells you why. It is
the first place to look.

## Scene 1 — open the log (0:08–0:25)
ON-SCREEN: 3-dots menu → Activity Log. Scroll through ~20
entries.
VOICEOVER:
Open Activity Log from the kebab menu. Every check writes entries.
You see when it ran. Which labels it scanned. How many new emails
it found. What each rule decided about each email. And any alert
dispatch errors.

## Scene 2 — reading a match (0:25–0:50)
ON-SCREEN: Highlight a multi-line block: timestamp →
"Checking label INBOX (3 new)" → "From: ... | Subject: ..." →
"Evaluating against rule 'Critical security alerts' ..." →
"MATCH! Email mentions a security incident from a known service"
→ "Calendar event created."
VOICEOVER:
Each new email shows the From address and Subject. Then a line per
rule it was evaluated against. A green MATCH means Gemini said yes.
The match line shows the reason. The lines after tell you which
channels fired.

## Scene 3 — reading a no-match (0:50–1:10)
ON-SCREEN: Highlight a block ending with "No match. The email is
about a marketing newsletter, not a security incident."
VOICEOVER:
A No match line tells you why Gemini decided the email does not
fit the rule. If you see No match for emails you think should
match, the rule text needs sharpening. Read the reason. Then
adjust.

## Scene 4 — failures and the retry (1:10–1:30)
ON-SCREEN: Highlight a red line — "MCP 'Asana' HTTP 401:
Unauthorized" — followed by "Evaluation failed — will retry next
run."
VOICEOVER:
Red lines are failures. Alert dispatch errors include the exact
response from the channel. Evaluation failures from Gemini quota
or transient network issues automatically retry on the next run.
You do not lose alerts to a temporary glitch.

## Scene 5 — Reset baseline (1:30–1:55)
ON-SCREEN: Settings card → Reset baseline button → confirmation.
VOICEOVER:
If you have changed rules and want to re-evaluate emails the
add-on already saw, hit Reset baseline in Settings. Be careful.
The next run will treat every recent message as brand new. It may
fire a flurry of alerts. Use Reset baseline for testing rule
changes, not in production.

## End card (1:55–2:00)
ON-SCREEN: Logo + Marketplace URL
VOICEOVER:

## Production notes

- Salt the Activity log with three different scenarios before
  recording: a match, a no-match, and a failure. The simplest
  way is (1) trigger a successful match, (2) write a rule that
  should not match an existing email and run a scan, (3)
  temporarily set an MCP server endpoint to a 401-returning URL
  for a fake failure.
- For Scene 5, demonstrate but Do not actually hit Reset
  baseline on a live deployment — record the click-and-confirm
  on a fresh demo account, then Cancel.
- The activity log in screenshot mode shows the demo From line
  ("Tester <test@example.com>") instead of real senders —
  do not forget to enable screenshot mode before recording.

## Recording checklist (Guidde)

Marked Descript for narration depth, but you can capture the click
flow with Guidde and overdub.

Before you start: Gmail open, demo account, Screenshot mode ON, the
Activity log **pre-salted** with all three scenarios — at least one
green MATCH, one No-match, and one red MCP failure (see Production
notes above for how to salt it). A fresh second demo account is
helpful for Scene 5 so you can demo Reset baseline without harming
real state.

1. Hit **Start capture** in the Guidde extension.
2. Click the **3-dot menu** on the home card.
3. Click **Activity Log**.
4. Scroll slowly down through ~20 entries.
5. Hover a multi-line MATCH block (timestamp → "Checking label
    INBOX (3 new)" → "From: ... | Subject: ..." → "Evaluating against
    rule '...'" → green "MATCH! ..." → "Calendar event created.")
    for ~3 s.
6. Scroll to a No-match block; hover the "No match. The email is
    about ..." line for ~3 s.
7. Scroll to a red MCP failure block; hover the
    `MCP "Asana" HTTP 401: Unauthorized` line, then the
    "Evaluation failed — will retry next run." line for ~3 s.
8. Click the **3-dot menu** → **Settings**.
9. Scroll to the **Reset baseline** button.
10. Click **Reset baseline**.
11. On the confirmation dialog, click **Cancel** (do **not** confirm
    on a live deployment).
12. Hit **Stop capture** in Guidde.

After capture: replace the auto-generated voiceover with the
storyboard VOICEOVER lines. The hover/dwell shots in steps 5–7 are
where most of the narration lives — make sure each pause is long
enough to read the highlighted lines.
