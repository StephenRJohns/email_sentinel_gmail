# emAIl Sentinel™

A Gmail Workspace Add-on that watches your Gmail for new messages and sends an alert when one matches a rule you describe in plain English. Rules are evaluated by **Google Gemini**.

Everything runs inside your Google account — no machine to keep running, no extra accounts to create.

> **Status: private pre-launch testing.** emAIl Sentinel is currently in private testing with a closed group of users. It is not yet listed on the Google Workspace Marketplace for general availability, and public sign-ups are not being accepted. The plan structure, pricing, and features documented below describe the product at launch; during private testing, access is invitation-only and free of charge. **At launch, the Service will be offered to United States users only** (see `legal/TERMS.md` § 2). EU/UK availability is deferred. See `legal/TERMS.md` § 1.1 for the governing pre-launch provision. For inquiries, contact [support@jjjjjenterprises.com](mailto:support@jjjjjenterprises.com).

## 1. What it does

When a new email arrives in a watched Gmail label, emAIl Sentinel asks Gemini whether it matches one of your rules. If it does, it fires the alerts you configured for that rule:

- **SMS** via your configured provider (bring your own — six quick-start presets plus a generic webhook for any other provider), to named recipients you define in Settings.
- **Google Chat**, **Google Calendar**, **Google Sheets**, **Google Tasks**, or **Google Docs** — all within your own Google account, no extra sign-up needed.
- **External integrations** — Microsoft Teams, Asana, any custom Model Context Protocol endpoint over HTTPS, or **any HTTPS webhook** (Slack incoming webhooks, Discord, n8n / Zapier / Make scenarios, custom internal APIs).

Rules are plain English. No regex, no code:

> *"If I get an email from any address at tma.com that has a PDF attachment that looks like an invoice or purchase order."*

```

All state lives in `PropertiesService.getUserProperties()`:

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `mailsentinel.settings` | Gemini key, model, poll interval, business hours, SMS config, alert channel IDs |
| `mailsentinel.rules`    | JSON array of rule objects |
| `mailsentinel.seen`     | Per-label list of recently-seen Gmail message IDs |
| `mailsentinel.log`      | Ring buffer of the last ~60 activity log lines |

`UserProperties` is **private to the running user** and **per-script** — nobody but you (and the add-on running in your account) can read it.

---

## 3. Pricing

emAIl Sentinel for Gmail is **free** — a fully-featured add-on with no paid tiers, no feature gates, and no in-app purchases. Every alert channel (SMS, Google Chat, Google Calendar, Sheets, Tasks, Docs, MCP servers, Asana, and custom HTTPS webhooks), unlimited rules, AI-assisted rule and alert writing, and the full activity log are available to everyone at no cost.

**About scan cadence:** Google Workspace enforces a **1-hour minimum** on time-based triggers in any Workspace add-on — a Google platform limit, not ours. Scheduled scans run at that floor; **Scan email now** (home card or the universal "⋮" menu) runs an immediate scan any time. The add-on runs **entirely inside your own Google account** — your email content never reaches our servers; it goes only to the Google Gemini API (with your own key) and the alert channels you configure.

**Want always-on, real-time monitoring?** [emAIl Sentinel Pro](https://jjjjjenterprises.com/emailsentinel/pro) is a separate, optional self-hosted product that watches Gmail (and Outlook) around the clock and fires alerts in real time — even when your computer is off. **$15/month**, **$150/year**, or **$149 lifetime** (first 100 buyers, then $199).

There is no build step, no `requirements.txt`, no installer. The whole thing is JavaScript that runs on Google's servers.

---

## 5. Prerequisites

- A Google account (personal Gmail or Google Workspace).
- A free **Gemini API key** from [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
- (Optional) An SMS provider account for SMS alerts — see [Alert channels](#11-alert-channels) for the six supported providers.
- For the `clasp` install path: [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org) and `npm`.

---

## 6. Install with `clasp`

`clasp` is Google's CLI for pushing local Apps Script files into a project.

```bash
# 1. Install clasp once, globally
npm install -g @google/clasp

# 2. Log in to your Google account in the browser that pops up
clasp login

# 3. From this directory, create a new Apps Script project
clasp create --type standalone --title "emAIl Sentinel" --rootDir .
#   ↑ this writes a real scriptId into .clasp.json

# 4. Push all the .gs / .html / appsscript.json files
clasp push

# 5. Open the project in the browser to install the add-on
clasp open
```

Inside the Apps Script editor:

1. Click **Deploy ▸ Test deployments**.
2. Click **Install** under "Test the latest code".
3. Choose **Gmail** as the host.
4. Approve the OAuth consent screen.
5. Open Gmail in another tab — the emAIl Sentinel icon appears in the right-hand add-on rail.

---

## 7. Install via the Apps Script editor (no CLI)

If you'd rather not install `clasp`:

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) → **New project**.
2. In the file tree on the left, create a file for each `.gs` and `.html` in this repo and paste in its contents. Replace the auto-created `Code.gs` with this repo's `Code.gs`.
3. Click the gear ▸ **Project Settings** ▸ check **Show appsscript.json** ▸ then open `appsscript.json` and replace its contents with this repo's `appsscript.json`.
4. **Deploy ▸ Test deployments ▸ Install** as in step 5 of the `clasp` flow above.

---

## 8. First-run configuration

After installation, open Gmail and click the emAIl Sentinel icon in the right rail.

1. **Settings ▸ Gemini API key** — paste your key. Click **Test Gemini** to confirm it works.
2. **Settings ▸ Scan schedule** — pick how often to check. The dropdown offers whole-hour intervals (`1 hour`, `2 hours`, `3 hours`, `4 hours`, `6 hours`, `8 hours`, `12 hours`, `24 hours`) down to the 1-hour Google Workspace platform floor, which cannot be bypassed. Use **Scan email now** for an immediate scan anytime.
3. **Settings ▸ SMS provider** *(optional)* — choose a provider and fill in credentials. Click **SMS setup guide** for a comparison. Then add named SMS recipients (e.g. "On-call", "CFO") below the provider fields — rules pick recipients by name, not raw phone numbers.
4. **Settings ▸ External integrations** *(optional)* — add Microsoft Teams, Asana (REST or MCP V2), any custom MCP endpoint (Cloudflare Worker, self-hosted bridge, etc.), or any HTTPS webhook URL (Slack incoming, Discord, n8n / Zapier, custom internal APIs).
5. **Settings ▸ Save settings**.
6. **Rules ▸ + New rule** — give it a name, list one or more Gmail labels (e.g. `INBOX`), describe the match in plain English, and tick the channels you want (SMS recipients, Chat spaces, MCP servers, Calendar, Sheets, Tasks). Click **Help me write the rule text** or **Help me write the alert text** to have Gemini draft a starting point. Or click **Starter rules** on the home card to create 5 pre-built rules (urgent emails, invoices, shipping updates, security alerts, and subscription renewals) — they are created disabled so you can tick channels and enable them at your own pace.
7. Back on the home card, pick a scan interval from the **Scan email every** dropdown (defaults to the 1-hour Google Workspace platform floor), then click **Start scheduled scans**. This installs a time-driven trigger that runs in the background even when Gmail is closed and saves the chosen interval into Settings.

The **first** check for any new label is treated as a baseline (no alerts) so you don't get a flood of notifications for existing mail. Alerts start with the next new message.

---

## 9. Writing rules

Rules are evaluated by Gemini against:

- the sender,
- the subject,
- the first 2,000 characters of the body,
- and the **filenames** of any attachments.

Attachment **contents** are not read.

Good examples:

- `"Any email from anyone @example.com that has a PDF attachment that looks like an invoice or purchase order."`
- `"Subject contains URGENT or CRITICAL."`
- `"Email from boss@example.com asking for a status update."`
- `"Automated notification about a server being down or an alert being triggered."`

Each rule also has an **Alert message content** field — plain-English instructions Gemini uses to compose the alert message itself. The default produces a date / sender / subject / summary / action items block; override it per rule when you want something different (a one-liner, a bullet list, …). The **Help me write the rule text** and **Help me write the alert text** buttons in the rule editor let Gemini draft either field for you based on the rule name, labels, and the channels you've ticked.

### Rule examples by alert channel

Every rule works with every channel — just enable the ones you want in the rule editor. Here are real-world examples showing which channels make sense for each use case.

#### SMS alerts — urgent, time-sensitive notifications

| Use case | Rule | Alert format | Channels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Server down** | "Any automated email about a server outage, service degradation, or critical alert from our monitoring system." | "One line: service name, severity, and what's affected." | SMS to the on-call engineer |
| **Wire transfer** | "Email from the bank confirming a wire transfer, ACH payment, or large transaction over $10,000." | "Amount, sender/recipient, and date only." | SMS to the CFO |
| **Security alert** | "Any email about a failed login attempt, password reset request, or suspicious activity on any of our accounts." | "Which account, what happened, and when." | SMS to security team |

#### Google Chat alerts — team-visible notifications

| Use case | Rule | Alert format | Channels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sales lead** | "Any email from a new contact (not in our company domain) that mentions pricing, demo, trial, or buying." | "Company name, contact name, what they're interested in, and their email." | Chat → "Sales Leads" space |
| **Support escalation** | "Any email with subject containing ESCALATION, P1, or CRITICAL from a customer." | "Customer name, issue summary, and severity." | Chat → "Support Escalations" |
| **Shipping notification** | "Email from FedEx, UPS, USPS, or DHL with a tracking number or delivery confirmation." | "Carrier, tracking number, and expected delivery date." | Chat → "Office Operations" space |

#### Google Calendar alerts — time-based follow-ups and phone notifications

| Use case | Rule | Alert format | Channels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Meeting request** | "Any email asking me to schedule a meeting, call, or demo." | "Who's asking, what they want to meet about, and any suggested times." | Calendar event |
| **Deadline reminder** | "Any email that mentions a deadline, due date, or 'by end of day/week'." | "What's due, when, and who's asking." | Calendar event |
| **Travel itinerary** | "Emails from airlines, hotels, or booking services with a confirmation or itinerary." | "Confirmation number, dates, and location." | Calendar event + Sheets log |

#### Google Sheets alerts — audit trails, reporting, and team visibility

| Use case | Rule | Alert format | Channels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Compliance log** | "Any email from a regulatory body, auditor, or containing 'compliance', 'audit', or 'regulation'." | "Date, sender, subject, and a one-sentence summary." | Sheets log |
| **Expense tracking** | "Emails containing receipts, invoices, or payment confirmations." | "Vendor, amount, date, and category." | Sheets log |
| **Hiring pipeline** | "Any email from job candidates or recruiting platforms." | "Candidate name, position applied for, and current stage." | Sheets log + Chat → "Hiring" space |

#### Google Tasks alerts — to-do items that need follow-up

| Use case | Rule | Alert format | Channels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Action item catcher** | "Any email that explicitly asks me to do something, review something, or approve something." | "What's being asked, by whom, and any deadline." | Task |
| **Contract review** | "Email with an attachment that looks like a contract, NDA, agreement, or legal document." | "From whom, document type, and any stated deadline." | Task |
| **Follow-up needed** | "Any email where someone says 'let me know', 'please confirm', 'get back to me', or 'awaiting your response'." | "Who's waiting, what they need, and when they sent it." | Task |

#### Combining multiple channels on one rule

The real power is mixing channels:

- **Critical vendor issue:** Rule: *"Email from any @example.com address marked urgent or mentioning an outage."* → SMS (instant phone buzz) + Chat "Client Escalations" (team sees it) + Calendar event (blocks your time) + Sheets (audit trail)
- **New hire onboarding:** Rule: *"Email from HR containing 'new hire', 'onboarding', or 'start date'."* → Task (to-do list) + Sheets (track all new hires) + Chat "People Ops" (team visibility)
- **Legal filing deadline:** Rule: *"Email from outside counsel or the court mentioning a filing deadline or hearing date."* → Calendar event (date on your calendar) + Task (action item) + SMS (don't miss it) + Sheets (matter log)

---

## 10. Gemini pricing and model tiers

emAIl Sentinel calls the Gemini API **twice per new email per active rule**: once to evaluate whether the email matches, and once to format the alert message. Already-seen messages are skipped entirely.

### Models (select in Settings)

| Model | Speed | Free quota | Paid input cost | Paid output cost | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** *(default)* | Fast | 1,500 req/day · 1M tokens/day | ~$0.075 / 1M tokens | ~$0.30 / 1M tokens | Most users — best balance of speed, cost, and accuracy |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** | Fastest | 1,500 req/day · 1M tokens/day | ~$0.04 / 1M tokens | ~$0.15 / 1M tokens | Simple rules at very high volume; slightly less capable |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | Slower | 50 req/day | ~$1.25 / 1M tokens | ~$5.00 / 1M tokens | Complex or nuanced rules where accuracy is critical; not suited for high email volume |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash 001** | Fast | 1,500 req/day · 1M tokens/day | ~$0.075 / 1M tokens | ~$0.30 / 1M tokens | Stable previous-generation Flash — fallback if 2.5 Flash behaviour changes |

> Verify current prices at [ai.google.dev/pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing). Prices shown are as of April 2026 and may change.

### Free tier (no billing required)

A key from [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) is free — no credit card required. Flash model free limits reset daily at midnight Pacific Time:

- **Flash models:** 1,500 requests/day and 1,000,000 tokens/day
- **Pro models:** 50 requests/day

When you hit a limit, Gemini returns HTTP 429 and emAIl Sentinel logs `"Gemini quota exceeded"` in the Activity Log. Scanning resumes automatically the next day — you are never charged on a free key.

### Estimating your daily usage

**Gemini calls per day ≈ new emails/day × active rules × 2**

Each call consumes roughly 600–1,500 tokens depending on email length and the complexity of your alert format prompt.

| Scenario | New emails/day | Active rules | API calls/day | Tokens/day (est.) | Free tier? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Light personal | 20 | 1 | 40 | ~50K | Well within |
| Typical personal | 50 | 3 | 300 | ~375K | Well within |
| Power user | 100 | 5 | 1,000 | ~1.25M | At / over limit — consider billing |
| Small business | 200 | 10 | 4,000 | ~5M | Needs paid tier |
| High volume | 500 | 20 | 20,000 | ~25M | Needs paid tier |

### Enabling paid usage

If you regularly hit the free limit:

1. Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) → select your API key → **Enable billing**.
2. Link a Google Cloud project that has a billing account attached.
3. The same API key continues to work in emAIl Sentinel — no settings change needed.

**Example monthly cost (Flash model, paid tier):**

| Usage | Input tokens/mo | Input cost | Output tokens/mo | Output cost | Monthly total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Typical personal (50 emails/day × 3 rules) | ~7M | ~$0.53 | ~1M | ~$0.30 | **~$0.83** |
| Power user (100 emails/day × 5 rules) | ~23M | ~$1.73 | ~4M | ~$1.20 | **~$2.93** |
| Small business (200 emails/day × 10 rules) | ~90M | ~$6.75 | ~14M | ~$4.20 | **~$10.95** |

> These are rough upper bounds. Emails that don't match a rule still cost one evaluation call; alerts that fire cost a second (formatting) call. Most rules match only a small fraction of emails, so real costs are typically lower.

### Tips to reduce Gemini spend

- **Enable Business hours** — restricts checks to your configured time window (supports overnight windows too).
- **Lower Max email age** (Settings ▸ Scan schedule) — default is 30 days; reducing it skips older messages entirely so they never hit Gemini.
- **Watch specific labels** (e.g. `Vendors/Invoices`) instead of INBOX — only emails in that label are evaluated against the rule.
- **Combine conditions** — one rule "Invoice OR purchase order from any vendor" is cheaper than two separate rules.
- **Keep alert format prompts short** — concise format instructions produce shorter output responses and lower output-token costs.
- **Raise the scan interval** — pick a longer interval in the Scan schedule dropdown (e.g. every 6 or 12 hours) instead of the tier minimum to reduce Gemini calls proportionally when email arrives in bursts.

## 11. Alert channels

### SMS
Google Workspace does not provide a first-party SMS API. emAIl Sentinel supports **any SMS provider you want** — ships with six quick-start presets (below) and a generic webhook for everything else. Click **SMS setup guide** in the add-on Settings for a comparison table with sign-up links and step-by-step instructions.

| Provider | Phone # needed? | Free trial? | Auth method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Textbelt** | No | 1 free/day (key: `textbelt`) | API key |
| **Telnyx** | Yes | Free credits | Bearer token |
| **Plivo** | Yes | $10 free credit | Basic auth |
| **Twilio** | Yes | $15 free credit | Basic auth |
| **ClickSend** | No | Free trial credits | Basic auth |
| **Vonage** | No | Free credits (no CC) | API key + secret |
| **Generic webhook** | (your choice) | N/A | (your choice) |

> **Prices vary by provider and change over time.** Current per-SMS and phone-number costs are shown in the in-app **SMS setup guide** and on each provider's website. Use the sign-up links in Settings to verify current rates before committing.

**How to choose:**
- **Quickest start (no sign-up):** Textbelt with the free key `textbelt` — 1 free SMS/day, no account needed.
- **Cheapest at scale:** Telnyx or Plivo (both sub-cent per US SMS, require you to rent a number).
- **No phone number to manage:** Textbelt, ClickSend, or Vonage send from a shared/system number.
- **Most popular / best docs:** Twilio.
- **Already have an SMS gateway or want to use an unlisted provider:** Generic webhook POSTs `{"to": "+15551234567", "body": "..."}` to any HTTPS URL you configure.

Phone numbers in SMS recipients should be in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164): `+15551234567`.

SMS recipients are managed in one place — **Settings ▸ SMS recipients** — as named entries (e.g. `On-call = +15551234567`). Rules pick recipients by name via checkboxes, so you don't paste phone numbers into each rule.

After configuring a provider in Settings, click **Send test SMS** to verify it works.

**A2P 10DLC compliance:** SMS providers (especially Twilio) require A2P 10DLC (Application-to-Person 10-Digit Long Code) registration for US phone numbers. After buying a number from your provider, register a campaign in their console (typically under A2P 10DLC or Messaging → Campaigns). The app provides guidance if registration is missing — you'll see an error directing you to complete the registration before SMS can be sent.

### Google-native channels (free)

These use your existing Google account — no third-party sign-up, no cost.

| Channel | What it does | How to set up |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Chat** | Posts to a Google Chat Space via webhook — the direct equivalent of Teams webhooks. **Requires a Google Workspace paid account** (webhooks are not available on free Gmail accounts). Pro plan only. | Create a Space at [chat.google.com](https://chat.google.com). Open the space, click the space name in the top header bar ▸ Apps & integrations ▸ Webhooks ▸ create one. In **Settings ▸ Google alert channels**, click "Add Chat space", enter the space name, and paste the webhook URL. Select the space name in each rule. |
| **Google Calendar** | Creates a 15-minute calendar event with the alert details. Phone/desktop notifications fire automatically if you have calendar notifications on. | (Optional) Enter a calendar ID in Settings, or leave blank for your primary calendar. In the rule editor, check "Create a Google Calendar event on match." |
| **Google Sheets** | Appends a row (timestamp, rule, from, subject, received, message) to a spreadsheet. Both date columns are written in the user's local timezone (`yyyy-MM-dd h:mm:ss AM/PM TZ`) — never UTC/Zulu. Great for audit trails, searching past alerts, sharing with a team. | (Optional) Enter a spreadsheet ID in Settings, or leave blank — emAIl Sentinel auto-creates one called "emAIl Sentinel — Alert Log" on the first alert. In the rule editor, check "Log to Google Sheets on match." |
| **Google Tasks** | Creates a task in Google Tasks with the alert subject and details. Shows in the Gmail sidebar and the Google Tasks app. | Leave the Tasks list ID blank for "My Tasks" (the default list). In the rule editor, check "Create a Google Task on match." |

Each Google channel is enabled per rule via a checkbox in the rule editor, so you can have some rules post to Chat and others log to Sheets, or combine all four.

### External integrations (MCP servers + Asana REST)

emAIl Sentinel can call any endpoint that speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTPS), and additionally offers a direct Asana REST path for the simplest Asana-task-creation case. Configure entries once in **Settings ▸ External integrations** and then tick them per rule.

| Type | What it does | Tool name (preset) |
|---|---|---|
| **Custom** *(recommended starting point)* | Any HTTPS MCP server — Cloudflare Worker, self-hosted bridge to Slack, your own internal tools. The Help card has a 40-line Cloudflare Worker walkthrough that gets you a working endpoint in about 15 minutes. | (you define, e.g. `log_alert`) |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Sends a Teams chat or channel message via a Microsoft Graph MCP server. Requires Entra ID app registration + OAuth (admin consent often required in enterprise tenants). | `send_message` |
| **Asana (REST API — easier)** | Direct Asana REST task creation — strictly speaking not MCP, but the simplest way to create Asana tasks. PAT-based, no OAuth flow. | (unused — direct REST) |
| **Asana (MCP V2 — requires OAuth)** | Creates a task via the official Asana MCP V2 gateway. Requires OAuth-issued access tokens (PATs are rejected). | `asana_create_task` |

For each server you configure:
- **Endpoint** — the MCP server's HTTPS URL
- **Auth token** — the `Authorization` header value (e.g. `Bearer sk-…`)
- **Tool name** — the MCP tool to call (preset by type; overrideable)
- **Tool args template** — JSON with `{{message}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{from}}`, `{{rule}}` placeholders that emAIl Sentinel fills in at dispatch time

Click **Load defaults** when editing a server to populate the tool name and args template for the selected type.

## 12. Privacy and storage

| What | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Your Gemini API key, SMS provider credentials, Chat webhook URLs, rules, seen-mail baseline, activity log | `PropertiesService.getUserProperties()` — per-user, per-script, private |
| Email contents (sender, subject, body excerpt, attachment names) | Sent to **Gemini** for evaluation; included in alert messages sent via the channels you enable. |
| Google Calendar events, Sheets rows, Tasks | Created in **your own** Google account |
| Google Chat messages | Posted to **your own** Chat Spaces via webhook URLs you configure |

Nothing is stored on any third-party server. The add-on has no backend. The Google-native channels (Calendar, Sheets, Tasks, Chat) all stay within your Google account.

## 13. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "No Gemini API key configured" in the activity log | **Settings ▸ Gemini API key** — paste a key, then **Test Gemini** |
| "Label '…' fetch failed" | Make sure the label exists in Gmail with that exact name (case-insensitive). For nested labels use the full path with `/`, e.g. `Vendors/Invoices` |
| Alerts firing for old mail right after install | **Settings ▸ Reset baseline** — the next run will re-baseline every label |
| SMS "HTTP 401" or auth error | Re-check your provider credentials in **Settings ▸ SMS provider**; both key fields must be saved |
| SMS "invalid from number" or delivery failure | Ensure the From number is provisioned on your provider account and the To number is in E.164 format (`+15551234567`) |
| MCP target system (Asana/Slack/Teams/etc.) not populated, but no error in the activity log | The dispatcher now surfaces tool-level MCP errors as `MCP alert to "<name>" FAILED: MCP "<name>" tool error: <detail>`. If you used to see no log line at all, push the latest code — earlier versions silently swallowed errors when the MCP server returned a Streamable-HTTP `text/event-stream` response (e.g. Asana V2 at `https://mcp.asana.com/v2/mcp`). Common detail texts: *Project not found* (bad `project_id`), *Forbidden* (PAT lacks workspace access), *Required field missing* (args template missing a required field). |
| MCP `Authorization` header rejected | Asana V2 / Slack / Teams expect the literal `Bearer <token>` (capital B, single space, then PAT). Pasting just the token without `Bearer ` produces an HTTP 401 in the activity log |
| Activity log times look "off" by several hours | Activity-log timestamps are now in 12-hour AM/PM in your local timezone (taken from your primary Google Calendar). If your Calendar's timezone is wrong, fix it in [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings) ▸ Time zone — emAIl Sentinel inherits that setting on the next run |
| Sheets row Timestamp / Received columns show `…Z` UTC strings | You're on an older deployment. Push the latest code — both columns now render as `yyyy-MM-dd h:mm:ss AM/PM TZ` in your local Calendar timezone |
| "Manage add-on" opens the Apps Script editor source code | This is identity-aware. As the add-on **owner / developer**, Google routes "Manage add-on" to the Apps Script editor. **End users** who installed the add-on from the Workspace Marketplace get the standard consumer dialog (uninstall, view permissions, manage data access) instead. To preview the consumer experience, install the published Marketplace listing on a separate Google account that doesn't own the script |
| Trigger doesn't seem to be running | Apps Script editor ▸ **Triggers** (left rail clock icon) — confirm `runMailCheck` is listed. If not, return to the home card and click **Start scheduled scans** again |
| Want to see exactly what the trigger did | **Activity log** card — newest entries first |

You can also peek at the trigger execution history in the Apps Script editor under **Executions** (left rail).

### Where to ask for help

- [**Community Discussions**](https://github.com/StephenRJohns/email_sentinel/discussions) — usage questions, rule-writing tips, sharing setups for SMS / Chat / MCP. Browse what other users are doing.
- [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/StephenRJohns/email_sentinel/issues) — bugs and feature requests; the developer monitors these directly.

Both are linked from inside the add-on: **Help** card → support links, and the kebab "⋮" menu → **Community discussions**. The home card also has a **Community** button next to **Help**.

## 14. Why an Add-on instead of a Chrome extension?

A Chrome extension only runs while a Chrome tab is open. emAIl Sentinel needs to scan Gmail continuously in the background — the right primitive for that is an **Apps Script time-driven trigger**, which runs server-side on Google's infrastructure whether or not you have Gmail open. A Workspace Add-on bundles that trigger together with a Gmail-rail UI for managing rules and settings.

If you'd rather have an in-Gmail browser-only experience too, the same `.gs` files can also be deployed as a **Gmail Add-on web app** through Google Workspace Marketplace; the manifest is already compatible.
