# emAIl Sentinel™ — Disclaimer

**Effective date:** 2026-07-09
**Operator:** JJJJJ Enterprises, LLC

## 1. No Guarantee of Alert Delivery

emAIl Sentinel depends on Google Apps Script infrastructure, the Google Gemini API, and (optionally) third-party SMS providers and MCP server endpoints. Any of these services may experience outages, rate limiting, quota exhaustion, or degraded performance at any time without notice. The Service may fail to check labels, evaluate rules, or dispatch alerts due to factors outside our control, including but not limited to Google infrastructure downtime, Apps Script execution timeouts, Gemini quota exhaustion, Gemini API unavailability, SMS provider unavailability, carrier filtering of SMS, or network interruptions.

**You must not rely on emAIl Sentinel for life-safety, medical, financial-trading, regulatory-compliance, or any other use where a missed or late alert could cause material harm.** The Service is an informational convenience tool, not a substitute for dedicated monitoring infrastructure, professional advisory services, or emergency notification systems.

The Service also depends on an active Google-issued OAuth grant for the `gmail.readonly` restricted scope. Google may, at its sole discretion, revoke, suspend, or limit that grant at any time — including as a result of its annual OAuth verification or security-assessment cycle. We have no obligation or ability to override a Google decision to restrict OAuth access, and we are not liable for any interruption, data loss, or missed alerts resulting from such a Google action.

## 2. AI Accuracy and Gemini Dependency

Rule evaluation and alert message generation are performed by Google Gemini, a large language model. AI-generated outputs are probabilistic, not deterministic, and may be inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, or misleading. emAIl Sentinel does not guarantee that Gemini will correctly classify any given email against any given rule.

**False positives** (alerts fired for emails that do not match your intent) and **false negatives** (emails that match your intent but produce no alert) are expected to occur. You should not make consequential decisions — financial, legal, operational, or otherwise — based solely on emAIl Sentinel alerts without independently verifying the underlying email content.

Gemini model behavior may change over time due to Google's model updates. JJJJJ Enterprises, LLC has no control over Gemini model behavior, outputs, availability, quota, pricing, or data handling. If Gemini is unavailable, degraded, quota-throttled, or discontinued — in whole or in part — the Service will not evaluate rules or dispatch alerts during that period. Content you send to Gemini is subject to Google's Gemini API terms; see the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) § 4.2 for details on what Google may retain and on the difference between free-tier and paid-tier content handling.

## 3. Email Content and Legal Responsibility

emAIl Sentinel reads the metadata and body of Gmail messages in the labels you configure. **You are solely responsible** for ensuring that:

- you have the legal right to access and process those messages;
- you have the legal right to transmit excerpts of their content to the Google Gemini API and to any SMS provider or alert channel you enable;
- your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws, including but not limited to privacy laws, wiretapping statutes, and employer–employee monitoring regulations in your jurisdiction; and
- you have obtained any required consents from senders, recipients, or other parties whose information appears in the emails you process.

JJJJJ Enterprises, LLC bears no responsibility for unlawful or unauthorized use of the Service.

## 4. Third-Party Services and Pricing

The Service integrates with third-party services including Google Gemini, any SMS provider you choose to configure using your own credentials or a generic HTTPS webhook endpoint, Google Chat, Google Calendar, Google Sheets, Google Tasks, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. JJJJJ Enterprises, LLC:

- does not operate, control, or guarantee the availability of any third-party service;
- is not responsible for any charges, overage fees, rate limits, data handling practices, or policy changes imposed by third-party providers;
- does not verify the accuracy of any third-party pricing shown in the add-on, help content, or marketing materials — including **SMS delivery cost estimates** and **Google Gemini API pricing**; all third-party cost figures are indicative only, are captured at a point in time, and may change at any time without notice from us. Always confirm current pricing on the provider's own pricing page before committing to usage;
- is not responsible for any failure by a third-party service to deliver an alert; and
- is not liable for data processed by a third-party service after the Service transmits it.
